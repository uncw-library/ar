<h5 class="card-title">Booking a Group Study Room</h5>
<p class="card-text">Got it! If you look around on the shelves, you might notice a lot of other books about coins around it; books in the Library of Congress system are organized by subject. We're making progress, but we need to spend some time looking through this book. The second floor is the quiet zone, but since we're dealing with a crime, it would be good to have somewhere more privateâ€”like one of the study rooms. </p>
<p class="card-text">Find a quick search kiosk (one of the touchscreens on stands) in the library and look up what group study rooms are available. </p>
