<h5 class="card-title">Searching for Books - Part 2</h5>
<p class="card-text">The librarian also mentioned that it's a good idea to search around a book on the shelf to see what else we have on that topic, so we should go get this one. Use the call number to find this book on the shelf. If you're not sure how to find the right section of the stacks upstairs, there are floor maps on the library website, on the digital display near the stairs, and at the Research Help Desk. </p>
