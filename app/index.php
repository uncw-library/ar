</h5>
<p class="card-text"><strong>What is this all  about?</strong></p>
<p class="card-text">Welcome to Randall Explorer! This game is designed to  show you around the library and its collections, so that when you need to  figure out how to find materials, book a study room, or get printing help,  you&rsquo;ll know what to do.</p>
<p class="card-text"><strong>The Story</strong></p>
<p class="card-text">First, let&rsquo;s set the scene: you&rsquo;re all detectives.  (Surprise! It&rsquo;s true.) Someone has stolen a collection of rare coins recovered  from a pirate shipwreck in the Cape Fear River. You need more information on  these coins to catch the thief if they try to resell them, so you&rsquo;re headed to  the library to do some research. </p>
<p class="card-text"><strong>How this works</strong></p>
<p class="card-text">You and your team will be following clues to find various places in the library, as well as on the library’s website and in our e-resources. At each spot in your search, you’ll find a mystery-themed icon like the one below, along with a short URL. Navigate to that URL on your phone’s browser and you’ll be given more information about the area you’re in, as well as the clue that will lead you to the next spot.</p>

<p class="card-text">Once you’ve completed the entire game, you’ll be taken to an online form. Fill out the form to receive your official Randall Explorer completion badge.</p>

<p class="card-text">We’ve got your first clue right here! In your browser, type the bit.ly URL below and follow the hint into the library to find the next step in the game.</p>
