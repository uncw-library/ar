<h5 class="card-title">Searching for Books - Part 1</h5>
<p class="card-text">Nice work! These are copies of older journals and magazines that have been bound togetherâ€”if we have an article in print instead of online, it's probably here. Not all old coins look alike, and you need to know how to identify them if you're going to spot them when the thief tries to resell them! The librarian found a book called The Practical Book of Cobs. </p>
<p class="card-text">Try looking it up on the library website and then seeing if you can find the book itself here in the library.</p> 

<p class="card-text">Use the call number to find this book on the shelf. If you're not sure how to find the right section of the stacks upstairs, there are floor maps on the library website, on the digital display near the stairs, and at the Research Help Desk.</p>
